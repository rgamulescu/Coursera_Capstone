For interested parties, this may mean that knowledge about venues in one city center can be used for decisions to be made about the other city center. As an example, an organization in the tourist industry may be able to point out similarities between both cities that may be of interest to its customers. Dissimilarities may point to unique aspects of Toronto and New York. \n",
